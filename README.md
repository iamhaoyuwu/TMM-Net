# TMM-Net
A SAR Ship Detection Method Based on Multi-scale Transformer Sampling

The code in this repository is currently undergoing organization and optimization. The complete version will be officially released once the process is finished.
For now, only some key code snippets have been placed here to provide a preliminary understanding of the core implementation logic.
Thank you for your understanding and attention. We will update the instructions promptly once the full code is released.
